## Range Selection

Although the implementation is up to you, two things are necessary.

**Place this code in your viewDidLoad() function** 

```swift
calendarView.allowsMultipleSelection  = true
calendarView.rangeSelectionWillBeUsed = true
```

The following delegate function is your first place to implement date ranges. Basically, you are checking to see what is your cell's selected position and applying the necessary changes.

```swift
func calendar(_ calendar: JTAppleCalendarView, didSelectDate date: Date, cell: JTAppleDayCellView?, cellState: CellState) {
   let myCustomCell = cell as! CellView // You created the cell view if you followed the tutorial
   switch cellState.selectedPosition() {
        case .full, .left, .right:
            myCustomCell.selectedView.isHidden = false
            myCustomCell.selectedView.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellow // Or you can put what ever you like for your rounded corners, and your stand-alone selected cell
        case .middle:
            myCustomCell.selectedView.isHidden = false
            myCustomCell.selectedView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue // Or what ever you want for your dates that land in the middle
        default:
            myCustomCell.selectedView.isHidden = true
            myCustomCell.selectedView.backgroundColor = nil // Have no selection when a cell is not selected
   }
}
```

This code also has to be placed the following 2 other delegate functions.

```swift
func calendar(_ calendar: JTAppleCalendarView, willDisplayCell cell: JTAppleDayCellView, date: Date, cellState: CellState) {
    // Place code here
}
func calendar(_ calendar: JTAppleCalendarView, didDeselectDate date: Date, cell: JTAppleDayCellView?, cellState: CellState) {
    // Place code here
}
```

Therefore since we do not want code duplication, lets create a separate function to handle the range selection. Change all the code you have done above to look like the following.

```swift
func handleSelection(cell: JTAppleDayCellView?, cellState: CellState) {
   let myCustomCell = cell as! CellView // You created the cell view if you followed the tutorial
   switch cellState.selectedPosition() {
        case .full, .left, .right:
            myCustomCell.selectedView.isHidden = false
            myCustomCell.selectedView.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellow // Or you can put what ever you like for your rounded corners, and your stand-alone selected cell
        case .middle:
            myCustomCell.selectedView.isHidden = false
            myCustomCell.selectedView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue // Or what ever you want for your dates that land in the middle
        default:
            myCustomCell.selectedView.isHidden = true
            myCustomCell.selectedView.backgroundColor = nil // Have no selection when a cell is not selected
   }

}
func calendar(_ calendar: JTAppleCalendarView, didSelectDate date: Date, cell: JTAppleDayCellView?, cellState: CellState) {
   handleSelection(cell: cell, cellState: cellState)
}
func calendar(_ calendar: JTAppleCalendarView, didDeselectDate date: Date, cell: JTAppleDayCellView?, cellState: CellState) {
    handleSelection(cell: cell, cellState: cellState)
}
func calendar(_ calendar: JTAppleCalendarView, willDisplayCell cell: JTAppleDayCellView, date: Date, cellState: CellState) {
    handleSelection(cell: cell, cellState: cellState)
}
```

Complete.


## Two-Tap range selection
___

But what if your calendar has a range selection design that behaves like this?

1. User taps first date
2. User taps second date
3. Your App should now select a range of dates from the start date to the end date.

You can accomplish this is what ever way you wish, but here is a rough example.

```swift
var firstDate: Date?

func calendar(_ calendar: JTAppleCalendarView, didSelectDate date: Date, cell: JTAppleDayCellView?, cellState: CellState) {
    if firstDate != nil {
       calendarView.selectDates(from: firstDate!, to: date,  triggerSelectionDelegate: false, keepSelectionIfMultiSelectionAllowed: true)
    } else {
       firstDate = date
    }
}
```

## Continuous range selection
___

If you want your users to select dates in a fluid motion or using any other kind of gestures, then you will need to [add gestures to your calendar](https://patchthecode.github.io/AddingGestures/). Here is an example adding long-press gesture.

<img width="300" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2439146/21446732/dea7361e-c87e-11e6-97ad-b0b66f355faa.gif">

You can code this any way you wish. Here is my rough sample code:

In your `viewDidLoad()` setup your gesture however you wish.

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
	calendarView.allowsMultipleSelection = true
	let panGensture = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(didStartRangeSelecting(gesture:)))
	panGensture.minimumPressDuration = 0.5
	calendarView.addGestureRecognizer(panGensture)
	calendarView.rangeSelectionWillBeUsed = true 
}
```
Then create the function to be executed

```swift
var rangeSelectedDates: [Date] = []
func didStartRangeSelecting(gesture: UILongPressGestureRecognizer) {
    let point = gesture.location(in: gesture.view!)
    rangeSelectedDates = calendarView.selectedDates
    if let cellState = calendarView.cellStatus(at: point) {
        let date = cellState.date
        if !rangeSelectedDates.contains(date) {
            let dateRange = calendarView.generateDateRange(from: rangeSelectedDates.first ?? date, to: date)
            for aDate in dateRange {
                if !rangeSelectedDates.contains(aDate) {
                    rangeSelectedDates.append(aDate)
                }
            }
            calendarView.selectDates(from: rangeSelectedDates.first!, to: date, keepSelectionIfMultiSelectionAllowed: true)
        } else {
            let indexOfNewlySelectedDate = rangeSelectedDates.index(of: date)! + 1
            let lastIndex = rangeSelectedDates.endIndex
            let followingDay = testCalendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: date)!
            calendarView.selectDates(from: followingDay, to: rangeSelectedDates.last!, keepSelectionIfMultiSelectionAllowed: false)
            rangeSelectedDates.removeSubrange(indexOfNewlySelectedDate..<lastIndex)
        }
    }
    
    if gesture.state == .ended {
        rangeSelectedDates.removeAll()
    }
}
```
